# When walking at my desk, my iphone and apple watch don't seem
# to accurately measure the distance that I walk. Luckily, my
# treadmill measure steps. Unfortunately, this the counter increments
# to 10k steps and then resets and I usually don't document the
# count before/after a walk. To make this approach a bit cleaner,
# I'll just turn off the treadmill each night, which will reset the
# counter in the morning...now to remember to document the steps
# in the health app.
