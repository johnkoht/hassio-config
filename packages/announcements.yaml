# General Announcement
#
# This script will broadcast an announcement across
# all announcement devices (e.g. sonos). It will first
# take a snapshot of anything playing, adjust the volume,
# make the announcement, and then resume.

  # Announcement Engine
  #
  # This script handles the entire announcement functionality.
  # Here's what this does:
  #
  # 1. Validate conditions (we're home and speech enabled)
  # 2. Take a Sonos snapshot
  # 3. Save the volumem for applicable current media_player
  # 4. Play a Ding! (and set the volume appropriately))
  # 5. Change the volume
  # 6. Play the TTS message on the applicable media players
  # 7. Restore the volumen to the media player
  # 8. Restore Sonos from the snapshot
