# Kohbo Dashboard

![Dashboard Overview](./kohbo/assets/dashboard-overview.jpg)

A custom Home Assistant dashboard system built with reusable templates and consistent design patterns.

> **Note:** This dashboard was designed for my specific home and needs. It's not intended to be a general-purpose theme or drop-in solution—but feel free to use it as inspiration or adapt components for your own setup.

## Overview

### Philosophy

I wanted a mobile dashboard that was intuitive, well-thought out, and didn't feel like a cluster of sensors and buttons. The focus was simplicity and usability. Rather than stack everything possible within the viewport, create a natural user flow to go from high-level to more detailed information, sensors, and actions. I wanted to build something that my wife and kids can without requiring consistent tech support. I'm still in the early alpha phase and WAF/SAF is unknown, so you've been warned.

The Kohbo dashboard prioritizes:

- **Consistency** — Every screen follows the same visual language and interaction patterns
- **Modularity** — Components are built as reusable templates that can be composed together
- **Information density** — Show relevant information at a glance without overwhelming
- **Dark-first design** — Optimized for wall-mounted tablets and low-light viewing

### Design Principles

1. **Template everything** — If you use it twice, make it a template
2. **Compose, don't duplicate** — Build complex UIs from simple, tested components
3. **State-driven styling** — Visual feedback should reflect device/entity state
4. **Mobile-friendly** — Works on phones, tablets, and desktop browsers

## Architecture

The dashboard uses a layered template system:

```

## Custom Components

The dashboard is built on two types of custom templates:

### Button Card Templates

Atomic UI components with JavaScript-based state logic. These handle styling, state display, and interactions for individual elements.

**Examples:** `kohbo_device_entity`, `kohbo_chip_card`, `kohbo_thermostat_entity`

### Decluttering Templates

Composed components that combine multiple cards with variable substitution. These create reusable page-level elements.

**Examples:** `room_card`, `climate_overview`, `thermostat_popup`

📖 **Template reference:** [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md#template-types)

## Theme

The dashboard uses a custom dark theme (`kohbo`) with a consistent color palette:

| Color | Variable | Usage |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 🔵 Blue | `--primary-color` | Active states, primary accent |
| 🟡 Yellow | `--accent-color` | Warnings, highlights |
| 🟢 Green | `--success-color` | Success states |
| 🔴 Red | `--error-color` | Errors, alerts |

**Background:** Dark grays (`#212529` → `#343A40`)  
**Text:** Light grays (`#F8F9FA` primary, `#CED4DA` secondary)

Full theme definition: [`themes/kohbo/kohbo.yaml`](/config/themes/kohbo/kohbo.yaml)

## Custom Icons

The dashboard uses a custom `kohbo` icon set, referenced as `kohbo:kohbo-<name>`.

Common icons include: `dashboard`, `rooms`, `security`, `climate`, `light`, `door-open`, `door-closed`, `window-open`, `window-closed`, `notification`, `room-occupancy`
