## What This Repo Is

A Home Assistant configuration for a fully automated smart home running on Home Assistant Yellow with Nabu Casa. The philosophy is **hundreds of small, focused automations** rather than monolithic ones — each room is an independent state machine. See `docs/` for in-depth documentation on rooms, people, presence, announcements, and devices.

---

## Validating & Applying Changes

No build system. Changes are applied by reloading or restarting Home Assistant.

```bash
ha core check              # validate YAML syntax
ha core reload-automations # reload automations without restart
ha core reload-scripts     # reload scripts
ha core restart            # full restart (use sparingly)
```

ESPHome devices are compiled/flashed separately:
```bash
esphome run esphome/<device>.yaml
```

## Modern HA Syntax (Required)

Always use modern syntax. The old syntax is deprecated. See `.cursorrules` for the full reference.

| Old (never use) | Modern (required) |
|---|---|
| `trigger:` | `triggers:` |
| `platform: state` | `trigger: state` |
| `condition:` | `conditions:` |
| `action:` | `actions:` |
| `service: light.turn_on` | `action: light.turn_on` |
| `entity_id: light.x` at root level | `target:` block with `entity_id:` |

```yaml
automation:
  - id: "example_automation"
    alias: "Example Automation"
    mode: single
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.motion
        to: "on"
    conditions:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: input_boolean.lighting_automations
        state: "on"
    actions:
      - action: light.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: light.office
        data:
          brightness_pct: 80
```

## Automation Style & Best Practices

These patterns are derived from the existing automations in this repo.

### One automation per file
Each automation lives in its own YAML file. The filename matches the automation ID.

```
packages/office/lights/office_lights_on.yaml    → id: "office_lights_on"
packages/security/alarm/alarm_arm_at_bedtime.yaml → id: "alarm_arm_at_bedtime"
```

### File header comment
Every automation file starts with a short comment block:
```yaml
# Office Lights On
#
# Turn on the lights when the office becomes occupied
# and illuminance is below threshold.
#

automation:
  - id: "office_lights_on"
```

### Naming
- IDs: `snake_case`, matching the filename (e.g. `office_lights_on`)
- Aliases: Natural language, room/feature name first (e.g. `"Office lights On"`, `"Alarm - Arm at Bedtime"`)

### Condition ordering — global → room → feature
Check the broadest/most-restrictive conditions first to fail fast:
```yaml
conditions:
  - condition: state                          # 1. house-level
    entity_id: input_boolean.house_occupied
    state: "on"
  - condition: state                          # 2. room-level
    entity_id: input_boolean.office_occupied
    state: "on"
  - condition: state                          # 3. feature-level
    entity_id: input_boolean.lighting_automations
    state: "on"
  - condition: numeric_state                  # 4. environmental
    entity_id: sensor.office_aqara_illuminance
    below: 150
```

### Use `for:` on triggers to prevent flapping
```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.office_aqara_motion_sensor
    to: "off"
    for:
      minutes: 3         # don't fire until motion has been off for 3 min
```

### Negate state with a template condition
```yaml
conditions:
  - condition: template
    value_template: "{{ not is_state('input_select.office', 'DnD') }}"
```

### Add `alias:` to complex conditions and actions
```yaml
actions:
  - if:
      - alias: "Speakers are grouped with another room"
        condition: template
        value_template: >
          {{ states.media_player.sonos_office.attributes.group_members | length > 1 }}
    then:
      - action: media_player.unjoin
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.sonos_office
```

### Modes
- `single` — default for almost all automations
- `queued` — scripts that manage shared resources (speakers, announcements)
- `restart` — when a new trigger should reset the current run (e.g. motion timers)

### Illuminance threshold
The standard lighting threshold across all rooms is **150 lux** (on below 150, off above 151).

### Secrets
Use `!secret` for all sensitive values:
```yaml
data:
  code: !secret alarmo_code
```

## Quality Standards

- **Follow existing patterns first** — before writing any automation, find a similar one in the same package and use it as the template. Don't invent structure that isn't already in the codebase.
- **Modern syntax, no exceptions** — if you catch yourself writing `trigger:`, `service:`, or `entity_id:` at the action root, stop and correct it.
- **Check the condition ladder** — every automation that affects lights, sound, or security must check the relevant house-wide booleans (`house_occupied`, `lighting_automations`, `speech_notifications`) before acting.
- **One automation, one job** — if an automation is doing two distinct things, split it into two files.
- **No fabrication** — don't invent entity names, sensor IDs, or room names. If you don't know the exact entity ID, say so and ask, or look it up in the relevant package directory.
- **Validate before presenting** — run `ha core check` mentally: does this YAML parse? Are all required fields present? Is the `target:` block used correctly?

---

## Subagent Strategy

Be liberal with subagents for this repo — the package tree is large and context is expensive.

- **Explore before writing** — when working on a room or feature you haven't seen, spawn an Explore subagent to read the existing package files before drafting anything. Pattern-matching against real files beats guessing.
- **One task per subagent** — research, file parsing, and parallel analysis each get their own subagent. Don't bundle unrelated lookups.
- **Parallel for independent work** — if you need to understand both `packages/security/` and `packages/announcements/` to answer a question, spawn both at the same time.
- **Reviewer subagent for non-trivial automations** — before presenting a new automation or package, spawn a subagent to verify it against: (1) correct modern syntax, (2) proper condition ordering, (3) consistency with how similar automations in that room/package are written.
- **Keep main context clean** — offload directory traversal, multi-file reads, and pattern searches to subagents. Return only the summary you need.
- **When in doubt, throw more compute** — a complex room refactor or new package is worth 2–3 parallel subagents investigating different aspects (existing automations, entity names, dashboard impact) before touching a file.

## Infrastructure Access — the `homelab` agent

This repo configures Home Assistant, but HA and its radios don't run here — they live on fleet hosts this repo has no knowledge of. When a task needs to reach that infrastructure, delegate to the user-level **`homelab`** agent (`Agent(subagent_type: "homelab")`). It carries the fleet topology, SSH table, and operational context, and it acts as read-mostly hands + eyes on the fleet.

**Relevant hosts for this repo:**
- **epicurus** (`10.0.10.85`) — Home Assistant itself (Docker). Query the recorder/history/API, read HA logs, check the container.
- **hermes** (`10.0.10.80`) — Z2M + MQTT + zwave-js. Z-wave/Zigbee device state, pairing, radio logs, energy-reporting nodes.
- ESPHome devices — flashed from `esphome/` here, but they run on the network and report through HA on epicurus.

**Delegate to `homelab` when you need to:**
- Pull real entity history / energy numbers from the recorder (not estimate them)
- Read HA, Z2M, or zwave-js logs to diagnose why a device isn't reporting
- Check whether a Z-wave/Zigbee node is alive, its config, or its reporting interval
- Verify a service is running or restart-worthy on epicurus/hermes

**What it will and won't do:** it diagnoses and pulls live data autonomously (read-only), but it does **not** mutate infrastructure — remote restarts or config changes come back as exact commands for you to approve. File edits in *this* repo remain your job; it can't touch them. Brief it like a colleague: what's wrong, which host/service, what you already tried.
