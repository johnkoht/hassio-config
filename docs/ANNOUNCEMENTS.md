# Voice Announcements

[Back to main README](../README.md)

This document explains the voice announcement system in my Home Assistant configuration.

## Overview

Voice gives the house a personality! The announcement system broadcasts TTS (text-to-speech) messages through Sonos-powered in-ceiling speakers throughout the house. Announcements are room-aware, meaning they only broadcast to occupied rooms unless it's a critical alert.

Key features:
- **Nabu Casa Cloud TTS** for speech synthesis
- **Sonos announce** feature for non-interruptive playback (music ducks and resumes)
- **Room-aware broadcasting** to occupied rooms only
- **Priority queue** to prevent overlapping announcements
- **Customizable chimes** including person-specific intro sounds

---

## Architecture

The announcement system uses a layered architecture. Automations call wrapper scripts that handle logic like room selection and sound mapping, which feed into a queue system, and finally the core engine broadcasts the audio. Critical announcements skip the queue and start the engine directly.

## Services

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `script.voice_announcement` | Primary TTS wrapper. Handles sound mapping, room-awareness, volume adjustment, and priority. |
| `script.critical_announcement` | Emergency broadcasts. Ignores occupancy, uses louder volume and alarm sound. Skips the queue and starts the engine directly. |
| `script.announcement_engine` | Low-level engine that plays the chime and TTS via Sonos announce. |
| `script.repeat_last_voice_announcement` | Replays the most recent announcement stored in `input_text.latest_voice_announcement`. |

---

## Voice Announcement

The `script.voice_announcement` is the primary way to trigger TTS throughout the house.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `speech_message` | The TTS message to broadcast | Required |
| `sound` | Chime sound to play before the message | `default` |
| `media_players` | Target speakers: `auto` for occupied rooms, `all`, or specific entity | `auto` |
| `priority` | Message priority: `critical`, `high`, `normal`, `low` | `low` |
| `expires_in` | Minutes until message expires (useful for time-sensitive reminders) | Based on priority |

### Example Usage

Basic announcement to occupied rooms:

```yaml
- action: script.voice_announcement
  data:
    media_players: auto
    sound: "one-chime"
    speech_message: "The upstairs washer is done and ready to be emptied."
```

Person arrival with custom intro sound:

```yaml
- action: script.voice_announcement
  data:
    media_players: auto
    sound: "alex"
    speech_message: "Alex just arrived home."
```

High-priority announcement that doesn't expire:

```yaml
- action: script.voice_announcement
  data:
    media_players: auto
    sound: "fanfare"
    speech_message: "Happy birthday!"
    priority: high
```

## Critical Announcement

The `script.critical_announcement` is for emergencies like fire, smoke, or water leaks. It differs from regular announcements:

- Broadcasts to **all rooms** regardless of occupancy
- Uses a **nuclear alarm** sound
- **Skips the queue**: it starts `script.announcement_engine` directly, so `house_occupied`, quiet mode before 9 AM and the queue's running flag can't hold it. A fire or alarm overnight is announced at once.
- Ignores time-of-day, `speech_notifications` and `bedtime` restrictions
- Doesn't touch queued messages. Non-critical ones are held while an emergency is active (see Emergency Mode)
- Quiet mode halves the volume, except while an emergency is active

```yaml
- action: script.critical_announcement
  data:
    media_players: all
    speech_message: "Warning! Water leak detected in the basement."
```

---

## Emergency Mode

`binary_sensor.emergency_active` is on while `alarm_control_panel.alarmo` is `triggered`, `binary_sensor.smoke_detector` is `on`, or the manual override `input_boolean.emergency_mode` is on (it turns itself off after 10 minutes, at HA start and after an automation reload). It's derived from real state, so it clears itself when the alarm or smoke clears.

While it is on:

- **The engine plays only `priority: critical`.** Its first step drops anything else, so the doorbell chime and hourly dong are silenced too. If the sensor is missing or unavailable the gate lets everything through.
- **The queue is held, not cleared.** The processor dequeues nothing but a critical item. When the emergency ends it resumes: expired items are dropped (low 3 min, normal 10 min), and so is every `low` item. Valid normal and high items still play.
- **TTS wait is `len/14 + 3` seconds** for every message (it was `len/17 + 1`), so the next item doesn't start over the end of the previous one.

Known gap: if an emergency starts after the processor has handed an ordinary item to the busy engine, the engine drops it and the processor still removes it from the queue.

Safe test: turn on `input_boolean.emergency_mode`, ring a test chime or enqueue a low message and confirm it's held, then call `script.critical_announcement` with a test message. Don't use the alarm, panic button or fire scripts: they notify Noonlight.

## Smart Behaviors

The announcement system has built-in intelligence to avoid being annoying:

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Time restrictions** | Only broadcasts between 6 AM and 11 PM |
| **Bedtime mode** | No announcements when `input_boolean.bedtime` is on |
| **Global toggle** | Respects `input_boolean.speech_notifications` |
| **Quiet mode** | Reduces volume by 50% when `input_boolean.quiet_mode` is on |
| **Music-aware** | Low/normal priority messages skip rooms actively playing music |
| **Room toggles** | Each room can disable TTS via `input_boolean.{room}_speech_notifications` |

---

## Queue System

The queue system prevents concurrent announcements and handles missed messages when nobody is home.

### How It Works

1. **Enqueue**: Messages are published to MQTT topic `home/announcement_queue/append`
2. **Append**: An automation processes the message and inserts it into the queue by priority
3. **Process**: When conditions are met, the processor pulls the next message and calls the engine
4. **Cleanup**: When the house becomes empty, low/normal priority messages are discarded

### Priority Ordering

Messages are processed in priority order:

| Priority | Use Case | Expires |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `critical` | Fire, smoke, leaks | Never |
| `high` | Important alerts | Never |
| `normal` | Regular announcements | 10 min |
| `low` | Non-essential info | 3 min |

`script.critical_announcement` no longer uses the queue. A `critical` item that still arrives through the queue (today: the severe thunderstorm warning, the extreme heat warning and hazardous air, all sent via `voice_announcement`; the tornado warning now uses `critical_announcement`) is put first, and `append.yaml` drops the other queued messages, as before.

### MQTT Topics

| Topic | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `home/announcement_queue/append` | Add new message to queue |
| `home/announcement_queue/data` | Queue state (JSON with queue array) |
| `home/announcement_queue/state` | Trigger for sensor updates |

### Queue Conditions

The processor only runs when:
- House is occupied
- Not in quiet mode before 9 AM
- No emergency is active, unless the next item is `critical`
- Queue is not empty
- No announcement currently playing
- An announceable room is occupied (for non-critical messages)

## Sound Library

Sounds are organized into categories:

### Chimes & Alerts

General notification sounds for different contexts:
- `default` - Standard notification chime
- `one-chime`, `chime` - Simple tone alerts
- `chirp` - Quick notification
- `arcade` - Playful alert
- `message-alert` - Message notification
- `fanfare` - Celebratory announcement

### Contextual Sounds

Sounds for specific situations:
- `school-bell`, `school-bell-chime` - School-related reminders
- `police-whistle` - Attention-grabbing alert
- `success-trumpets` - Achievement/completion
- `harp-flourish` - Gentle notification
- `fox-nfl` - Sports-related

### Person Intros

Custom intro sounds for family members when they arrive/depart:
- `alex`, `yara`, `shawn`, `jido`, `genny`

These play a personalized intro (music clip, sound effect) before announcing the person's arrival.

## Common Use Cases

Here are some examples of how announcements are used throughout the house:

| Automation | Sound | Example Message |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| Person arrival | Person-specific | "Alex just arrived home" |
| Person departure | Person-specific | "John just left" |
| Laundry done | `one-chime` | "The upstairs washer is done" |
| Calendar reminder | `default` | "Reminder: Soccer practice in 30 minutes" |
| Garage door open | `chirp` | "The garage door has been open for 10 minutes" |
| Morning update | `fanfare` | Weather, calendar, school info |
| Severe weather | `default` | "Severe thunderstorm warning in effect" |
| Water leak | Nuclear alarm | "Warning! Water leak detected" |
